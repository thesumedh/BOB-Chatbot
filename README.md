## Bank of Baroda Hackathon - Customer Service Enhancement with Azure OpenAI

**Introduction**

This project explores the potential of Azure OpenAI to enhance customer service at Bank of Baroda. We propose "BOB's AI Assistant," a chatbot designed to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction across various channels.

**Challenge**

Traditional customer service often faces challenges like:

* Long wait times
* Difficulty finding clear answers
* Lack of personalized recommendations
* Business Help 

**Solution**

BOB's AI Assistant leverages Azure OpenAI to address these issues:

* **Phase 1: Core Functionalities**
    * **Automate Common Inquiries:** Train an Azure OpenAI model (e.g., Text-babbage-001) to answer common questions (account balance, transaction details) in real-time.
    * **Information Retrieval:** Integrate the model with Bank of Baroda's knowledge base to provide summaries of relevant information from FAQs or documents.
* **Phase 2: Future Enhancements (if time allows)**
    * **Personalized Recommendations:** Analyze customer data (with consent) to suggest relevant bank products or services.
    * **Seamless Integration:** Explore integrating BOB's AI Assistant with existing customer service platforms.

**Benefits**

* Faster resolution times for common inquiries
* Improved information access for customers
* Enhanced customer experience through a user-friendly interface
* Reduced workload on human agents

**Azure OpenAI Implementation**

* Fine-tune a chosen model on a dataset of customer service interactions using Azure OpenAI API.
* Integrate the trained model with a chatbot framework for user interaction.

**Project Delivery**

* A public GitHub repository will be created to house project code, documentation (excluding sensitive information), and details on training data.
* A presentation will showcase BOB's AI Assistant's functionalities and its potential impact.

**Focus & Security**

* We prioritize achievable goals within the timeframe, highlighting the potential for future enhancements.
* We emphasize commitment to data privacy regulations and maintaining high security standards.
